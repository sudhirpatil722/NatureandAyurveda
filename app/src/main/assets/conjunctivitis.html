			<h1>Conjunctivitis</h1>

			<h4>
				<p>Pink eye, also known as conjunctivitis, is an irritating and
					uncomfortable condition with symptoms like redness, itching,
					inflammation, tearing, and sensations of a foreign body or burning
					in the eyes. The condition can be caused by bacteria, a virus, or
					allergies.</p>
				<p>When caused by bacterial infection, it usually affects both
					eyes and is accompanied by pus draining from the eyes. In the case
					of a viral infection, it tends to affect one eye first and then the
					other eye, after a few days. The discharge from the eyes is clear
					and watery. In both cases, the infection is highly contagious.</p>
