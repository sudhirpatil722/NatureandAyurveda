			<h1>Vertigo</h1>

			<h4>
				<p>Vertigo is nothing but dizziness through a sensation that you
					or your environment is moving although there is no actual movement.
					It may be accompanied by other symptoms like nausea, vomiting, loss
					of balance, tinnitus, temporary hearing loss or a feeling of
					fullness in the ear.</p>
				<p>Vertigo itself is more of a symptom than a disease and is
					different from the nonspecific light headedness or dizziness.</p>
