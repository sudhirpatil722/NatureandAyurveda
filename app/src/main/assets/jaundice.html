			<h1>Jaundice</h1>

			<h4>
				<p>Jaundice commonly develops in babies, usually soon after
					birth. However it can affect adults also.</p>
				<p>It occurs due to an increased level of the yellowish bile
					pigments, known as bilirubin, in the blood. Bilirubin is a
					by-product of the body's natural process of breaking down &
					removing old & damaged red blood cells.</p>
				<p>It is usually flushed out of the body by the liver, just like
					many other naturally occurring waste products. When the liver
					cannot do so for some reason, the level of bilirubin in the blood
					rises and causes jaundice.</p>
				<p>The most common symptom of jaundice is yellowing of the skin,
					eyes, tongue and urine. Depending on the underlying cause, other
					symptoms may include fatigue, headache, fever, loss of appetite,
					nausea, vomiting, weight loss, abdominal pain, skin itching and
					pale-coloured stools.</p>
