			<h1>Sprained Ankle</h1>

			<h4>
				<p>Sprain is a common phenomenon observed due to joint twists,
					thereby leading to ligament injury. Ligaments connect the bones in
					the joint and therefore should be intact to ensure healthy bones.</p>
				<p>Ankle sprains are generally caused by running or walking on
					uneven ground, donning high-heeled footwear or lifting heavy
					weights.</p>
				<p>Pain, swelling, bruising and restricted range of motion are
					common symptoms.</p>

			<h5>First Aid</h5>
			<h6>Apply ice wrapped in a cloth on the sprained area. This
				controls swelling. A compress or bandage can also be handy. However,
				donâ€™t put bandage if the affected area turns blue or begins to feel
				numb.</h6>
