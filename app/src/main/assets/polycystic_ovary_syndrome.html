			<h4>
				<p>Polycystic ovary syndrome is a common condition related to a
					hormonal imbalance in women of reproductive age. It is
					characterized by high levels of androgens in the body.</p>

					cycle, cysts on the ovaries and problems getting pregnant.</p>
				<p>Although there is no cure for this problem yet, it can be
					controlled. Some simple home-made remedies can help manage the
					symptoms and reduce complications.</p>
