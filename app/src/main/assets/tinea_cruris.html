			<h1>Tinea Cruris</h1>

			<h4>
				<p>Tinea Cruris (jock itch) is a fungal skin infection that
					mainly affects the inner thighs, groin area and the buttocks.</p>
				<p>It is caused by a group of fungi called dermatophytes that
					like to grow on skin thatâ€™s moist and warm and thrive in areas
					where skin comes into contact with other skin. This infection is
					common among people who sweat a lot. It can affect both men and
					women, but men are more likely to get it.</p>
