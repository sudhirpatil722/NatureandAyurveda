			<h1>Kidney Stone</h1>

			<h4>
				<p>Kidney stones are formed from the chemicals in urine, such as
					uric acid, phosphorous, calcium and oxalic acid. Kidney stones can
					also be cause due to excessive consumption of vitamin D, a mineral
					imbalance, dehydration, gout and an improper diet.</p>
				<p>Make sure to drink plenty of water. If you drink eight to 10
					glasses of water along with other kinds of fluids daily, the colour
					of your urine will become clear, which is a good sign.</p>
