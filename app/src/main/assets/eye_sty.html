			<h1>Eye Sty</h1>

			<h4>
				<p>A sty is an acute infection of the oil glands of the eyelids
					that results in a firm, red lump on the eyelid. Sometimes it gets
					filled with pus.</p>
				<p>Sties are caused by dirt, makeup, or other debris that block
					and infect the oil gland with bacteria.</p>
				<p>Common symptoms of sties include pain, swelling, tenderness,
					burning sensation, itching, difficulty blinking, increased
					sensitivity to light, and mucus discharge from the affected eye.</p>
