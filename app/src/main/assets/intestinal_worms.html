			<h1>Intestinal Worms</h1>

			<h4>
				<p>Intestinal worms are parasites in the gastrointestinal tract,
					primarily on the intestinal wall, that affect people and other
					organisms.</p>
				<p>Parasites enter the human body through contaminated food or
					water, transmitting agents like mosquitoes, sexual contact and even
					via nose and skin. Other common causes include poor hygiene,
					exposure to areas known to have parasites, weak immune system and
					eating raw and undercooked meat.</p>
