			<h1>Obesity & Weight Loss</h1>

			<h4>
				<p>Obesity, which is excessive accumulation of fat in the body,
					is mostly attributed to poor lifestyle choices, such as eating
					processed foods high in fat, oversized food portions, overeating,
					excessive drinking, lack of physical activity, lack of sleep, and
					other similar habits.</p>
