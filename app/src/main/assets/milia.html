			<h1>Milia</h1>

			<h4>
				<p>Milia, also called milk spots, are little white or yellowish
					bumps that commonly appear around and under the eyes. They can also
					appear on the nose, cheeks, forehead and chest.</p>
				<p>Basically, milia are keratin-filled cysts that are considered
					unsightly but harmless.</p>
				<p>The problem occurs when the skin cannot remove dead skin
					cells, thereby causing clogged pores.</p>
